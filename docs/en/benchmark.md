# Benchmark and Model Zoo

For optimization-based methods, we provide configuration files and log files.
For learning-based methods, we provide configuration files, log files and pretrained models.
Moreover, all supported methods are evaluated on three common benchmarks: Campus, Shelf, and CMU Panoptic.
