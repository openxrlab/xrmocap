## Data Preparation

Download data from the file server, and extract files to `tests/data`.

```
sh scripts/download_test_data.sh
```

## Environment Preparation

Install packages for test.

```
pip install -r requirements/tests.txt
```

## Running tests through pytest

Running all the tests below `test/`. It is a good way to validate whether `XRMoCap` has been correctly installed:

```
pytest test/
```

Generate a coverage for the test:

```
coverage run --source xrmocap -m pytest test/
coverage xml
coverage report -m
```
