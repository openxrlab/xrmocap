       TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION

       1. Definitions.

          "License" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,
          and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.

          "Licensor" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by
          the copyright owner that is granting the License.

          "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
          other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
          control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
          "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
          direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
          otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
          outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

          "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
          exercising permissions granted by this License.

          "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
          including but not limited to software source code, documentation
          source, and configuration files.

          "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
          transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
          not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
          and conversions to other media types.

          "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
          Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
          copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
          (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

          "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
          form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
          editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
          represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
          of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
          separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
          the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

          "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
          the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
          to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
          submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
          or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
          the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
          means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
          to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
          communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
          and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
          Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
          excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
          designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

          "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
          on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
          subsequently incorporated within the Work.

       2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
          publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
          Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

       3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
          this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
          worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
          (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
          use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
          where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
          by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
          Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
          with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
          institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
          cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
          or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
          or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
          granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
          as of the date such litigation is filed.

       4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
          Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
          modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
          meet the following conditions:

          (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
              Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

          (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
              stating that You changed the files; and

          (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
              that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
              attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
              excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
              the Derivative Works; and

          (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
              distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
              include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
              within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
              pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
              of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
              as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
              documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
              within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
              wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
              of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
              do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
              notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
              or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
              that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
              as modifying the License.

          You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
          may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
          for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
          for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
          reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
          the conditions stated in this License.

       5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
          any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
          by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
          this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
          Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
          the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
          with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

       6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
          names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
          except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
          origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

       7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
          agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
          Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
          WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
          implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
          of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
          PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
          appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
          risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

       8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
          whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
          unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
          negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
          liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
          incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
          result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
          Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
          work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
          other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
          has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

       9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
          the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
          and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
          or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
          License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
          on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
          of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
          defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
          incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
          of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

If you do not agree with these terms and conditions, you must not download and/or use the Model & Software. Any infringement of the terms of this agreement will automatically terminate your rights under this License

    Ownership / Licensees
    The Software and the associated materials has been developed at the

    Max Planck Institute for Intelligent Systems (hereinafter "MPI").

    Any copyright or patent right is owned by and proprietary material of the

    Max-Planck-Gesellschaft zur Förderung der Wissenschaften e.V. (hereinafter “MPG”; MPI and MPG hereinafter collectively “Max-Planck”)

    hereinafter the “Licensor”.

    License Grant
    Licensor grants you (Licensee) personally a single-user, non-exclusive, non-transferable, free of charge right:

    To install the Model & Software on computers owned, leased or otherwise controlled by you and/or your organization;
    To use the Model & Software for the sole purpose of performing non-commercial scientific research, non-commercial education, or non-commercial artistic projects;
    Any other use, in particular any use for commercial, pornographic, military, or surveillance, purposes is prohibited. This includes, without limitation, incorporation in a commercial product, use in a commercial service, or production of other artifacts for commercial purposes. The Data & Software may not be used to create fake, libelous, misleading, or defamatory content of any kind excluding analyses in peer-reviewed scientific research. The Data & Software may not be reproduced, modified and/or made available in any form to any third party without Max-Planck’s prior written permission.

    The Data & Software may not be used for pornographic purposes or to generate pornographic material whether commercial or not. This license also prohibits the use of the Software to train methods/algorithms/neural networks/etc. for commercial, pornographic, military, surveillance, or defamatory use of any kind. By downloading the Data & Software, you agree not to reverse engineer it.

    No Distribution
    The Model & Software and the license herein granted shall not be copied, shared, distributed, re-sold, offered for re-sale, transferred or sub-licensed in whole or in part except that you may make one copy for archive purposes only.

    Disclaimer of Representations and Warranties
    You expressly acknowledge and agree that the Model & Software results from basic research, is provided “AS IS”, may contain errors, and that any use of the Model & Software is at your sole risk. LICENSOR MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND CONCERNING THE MODEL & SOFTWARE, NEITHER EXPRESS NOR IMPLIED, AND THE ABSENCE OF ANY LEGAL OR ACTUAL DEFECTS, WHETHER DISCOVERABLE OR NOT. Specifically, and not to limit the foregoing, licensor makes no representations or warranties (i) regarding the merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose of the Model & Software, (ii) that the use of the Model & Software will not infringe any patents, copyrights or other intellectual property rights of a third party, and (iii) that the use of the Model & Software will not cause any damage of any kind to you or a third party.

    Limitation of Liability
    Because this Model & Software License Agreement qualifies as a donation, according to Section 521 of the German Civil Code (Bürgerliches Gesetzbuch – BGB) Licensor as a donor is liable for intent and gross negligence only. If the Licensor fraudulently conceals a legal or material defect, they are obliged to compensate the Licensee for the resulting damage.
    Licensor shall be liable for loss of data only up to the amount of typical recovery costs which would have arisen had proper and regular data backup measures been taken. For the avoidance of doubt Licensor shall be liable in accordance with the German Product Liability Act in the event of product liability. The foregoing applies also to Licensor’s legal representatives or assistants in performance. Any further liability shall be excluded.
    Patent claims generated through the usage of the Model & Software cannot be directed towards the copyright holders.
    The Model & Software is provided in the state of development the licensor defines. If modified or extended by Licensee, the Licensor makes no claims about the fitness of the Model & Software and is not responsible for any problems such modifications cause.

    No Maintenance Services
    You understand and agree that Licensor is under no obligation to provide either maintenance services, update services, notices of latent defects, or corrections of defects with regard to the Model & Software. Licensor nevertheless reserves the right to update, modify, or discontinue the Model & Software at any time.

    Defects of the Model & Software must be notified in writing to the Licensor with a comprehensible description of the error symptoms. The notification of the defect should enable the reproduction of the error. The Licensee is encouraged to communicate any use, results, modification or publication.
