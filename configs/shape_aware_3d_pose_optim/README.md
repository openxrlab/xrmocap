## Introduction

We provide the config files for Shape-aware 3D Pose Optimization, which is the second stage in the [Shape-aware Multi-Person Pose Estimation from Multi-View Images](https://ait.ethz.ch/projects/2021/multi-human-pose/).

## Results

We use keypoints3d generated by MVPose or MVPose tracking to generate the SMPL, then iteratively optimize keypoints3d using 2D perception data and SMPL, report the Percentage of Correct Parts (PCP) on Shelf datasets. It should be noted that the optimization result depends on the SMPL accuracy of the fitting.

You can find more details in the [config](shape_aware_3d_pose_optimizer.py), where `kps3d_optimizers` is shape-aware 3d pose optimizer, you can set the iteration number. For more details, see docs for `SMPLShapeAwareOptimizer` and the docstring in [code](../../xrmocap/transform/keypoints3d/optim/smpl_shape_aware_optimizer.py).
